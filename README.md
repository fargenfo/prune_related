This tool uses a heuristic to remove highly related individuals, based on a supplied kinship matrix and
a threshold. The output of the pruning procedure is then a list of individuals to keep.

The networkx (v2.1 or newer) Python library must be installed in the environment.

* Find relationships where kinship is above threshold
* Construct a graph, where two individuals are connected if they are highly related
* Find an approximate maximum independent set

A maximum independent set is a set of nodes of a graph such that no two nodes are connected in the graph. We
find an approximation to the maximum independent set using a NetworkX implementation of an algorithm
described in the following paper:

Usage:
    python prune_related.py [kinship matrix] [threshold] [output file]

Input:
    Kinship matrix:     Path to CSV file with kinship coefficients between individuals. The CSV must be comma
                        separated and have no column or row names.
    Threshold:          Pairs of individuals with kinship above this will be considered highly related.
    Output file:        Output will be written to a file with this path.

Example:
    python prune_related.py kinship_matrix.csv 0.0625 pruned_individuals.txt

Output:
    The indexes of individuals remaining after pruning are written to the specified output file.
